N  = window size
Rn = request number
Sn = sequence number
Sb = sequence base
Sm = sequence max

Receiver:
Rn = 0
Do the following forever:
If the packet received = Rn and the packet is error free
        Accept the packet and send it to a higher layer
        Rn = Rn + 1
        Send a Request for Rn
Else
        Refuse packet
        Send a Request for Rn
        
Sender:
Sb = 0
Sm = N − 1
Repeat the following steps forever:
1. If you receive a request number where Rn > Sb 
        Sm = Sm + (Rn − Sb)
        Sb = Rn
2.  If no packet is in transmission, 
        Transmit a packet where Sb <= Sn <= Sm.  
        Packets are transmitted in order.
